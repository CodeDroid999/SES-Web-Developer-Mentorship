## 1. What Are Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)?

### Definition
Progressive Web Apps are web applications that use modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like experience to users. They are reliable, fast, and engaging.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Reliable**: Work offline or with poor network conditions.
- **Fast**: Provide quick load times and smooth interactions.
- **Engaging**: Feel like a native app with immersive user experiences.

---

## 2. Core Features of PWAs

### Features:
1. **Installable**: Can be added to the home screen.
2. **Offline Support**: Work without internet using caching.
3. **Push Notifications**: Engage users with timely updates.
4. **App-Like Feel**: Mimics native app UX.
5. **Cross-Platform**: Works on all devices and browsers.

---

## 3. Service Workers

### What Are Service Workers?
Service Workers are JavaScript files that run in the background, intercept network requests, and provide offline capabilities.

### Lifecycle:
1. **Install**: Triggered when the Service Worker is installed.
2. **Activate**: Ensures old caches are cleared.
3. **Fetch**: Intercepts requests and serves cached responses.

### Example:
```javascript
self.addEventListener('install', (event) => {
  event.waitUntil(
    caches.open('my-cache').then((cache) => {
      return cache.addAll(['/index.html', '/styles.css', '/script.js']);
    })
  );
});

self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
  event.respondWith(
    caches.match(event.request).then((response) => {
      return response || fetch(event.request);
    })
  );
});

## 4. Web App Manifest

### What Is It?
The Web App Manifest is a JSON file that provides metadata about your app, such as its name, icons, and start URL.

### Example:
```json
{
  "name": "My PWA",
  "short_name": "PWA",
  "start_url": "/index.html",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#ffffff",
  "theme_color": "#000000",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "icon-192x192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "icon-512x512.png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 5. Caching Strategies

### Types of Caching:
1. **Cache First**: Serve from cache, then update.
2. **Network First**: Fetch from the network, fallback to cache.
3. **Stale-While-Revalidate**: Serve from cache while updating the cache.

---

## 6. Implementing Offline Mode

### Steps:
1. Register a Service Worker.
2. Cache assets during installation.
3. Serve cached assets during fetch events.

---

## 7. Testing and Debugging PWAs

### Tools:
1. **Lighthouse**: Audit PWA capabilities.
2. **DevTools Application Tab**: Test Service Workers and cache.
3. **Manifest Validator**: Check Web App Manifest for errors.

# Day 5 Tasks: Progressive Web Apps (PWA)

---

## Task 1: Create a Web App Manifest
1. Create a `manifest.json` file for your project.
2. Add details such as app name, icons, and theme color.
3. Link the manifest to your HTML file using:
   ```html
   <link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json">
   ```

---

## Task 2: Register a Service Worker
1. Write a `service-worker.js` file to cache key assets (`index.html`, `styles.css`, etc.).
2. Register the Service Worker in your main JavaScript file:
   ```javascript
   if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
     navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js')
       .then(() => console.log('Service Worker registered!'))
       .catch((error) => console.error('Service Worker registration failed:', error));
   }
   ```

---

## Task 3: Implement Offline Support
1. Use the Service Worker to serve cached files when offline.
2. Test the offline functionality using the Application tab in DevTools.

---

## Task 4: Audit Your PWA
1. Use Lighthouse to audit your app for PWA compliance.
2. Fix any issues identified during the audit.

---

## Bonus Task: Add Push Notifications
1. Use the Notifications API to display a notification when the app is opened.
2. Example:
   ```javascript
   Notification.requestPermission().then((permission) => {
     if (permission === 'granted') {
       new Notification('Welcome to My PWA!');
     }
   });
   ```
```
