### **Week 4 - Day 3: Advanced Server-Side Rendering (SSR) in Next.js**

---

#### **Course Content:**

### **Understanding Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**
Server-Side Rendering (SSR) is the process of generating HTML for a page on the server for each request. Unlike Static Site Generation (SSG), which pre-builds pages at build time, SSR generates pages dynamically on each request, ensuring that the content is always fresh. **Next.js** offers an easy way to implement SSR using the `getServerSideProps` method.

#### **Topics Covered:**
1. **What is SSR and How It Works**:
   - SSR renders pages on the server for each request, ensuring that users always get the most up-to-date content.
   - This process is particularly useful for pages with dynamic content that changes often (e.g., user dashboards, news sites, or product pages).
   - In Next.js, the `getServerSideProps` function allows you to fetch data on the server before rendering the page.

2. **Using `getServerSideProps`**:
   - Learn how to use `getServerSideProps` to fetch data on every request for SSR in Next.js.
   - Understand the lifecycle of SSR, how the server handles requests, and sends the HTML response with data.
   
3. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Understand the performance trade-offs of SSR compared to SSG.
   - SSR can be slower than SSG since it needs to fetch and generate pages on every request.
   - Explore techniques for optimizing SSR, such as caching strategies and data-fetching optimizations.

4. **Dynamic Data with SSR**:
   - Learn how to pass dynamic data to your pages using SSR, such as user-specific data, session information, or data that changes frequently.
   - Implement an SSR page that fetches real-time data from an external API.

5. **When to Use SSR vs. SSG**:
   - Understand the scenarios where SSR is the better choice, such as when content changes frequently and cannot be cached.
   - Learn to decide between SSG and SSR based on your appâ€™s needs.

#### **Practical Implementation**:

##### **1. Fetching Data with `getServerSideProps`**:
   - Build a page in Next.js that fetches dynamic content from an API (e.g., weather data, user information, or product details).
   - Implement `getServerSideProps` to fetch this data on every request to ensure the content is always up-to-date.

##### **2. Creating a Real-Time Dashboard**:
   - Create a user dashboard that displays real-time data fetched from a server. Use `getServerSideProps` to pull the latest user data whenever the page is loaded.

##### **3. Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement performance optimizations, such as caching the results from the API or using server-side caching solutions (e.g., Redis, CDN caching).
   - Explore how to minimize the load time for SSR pages.

### **Hands-On Assignment for Day 3:**

#### **Tasks:**

1. **Create an SSR Page in Next.js**:
   - Build a page that uses `getServerSideProps` to fetch data from a real API or a mock API.
   - Ensure that the page shows dynamic data based on the request, such as current weather or user-specific information.
   
2. **Implement Dynamic Content Fetching**:
   - Use SSR to fetch real-time data based on the user's location or session. Display this data on the page (e.g., a personalized greeting or recent transactions).

3. **Optimize SSR Performance**:
   - Implement caching to reduce the load time of SSR pages. Consider using solutions like Redis, CDN, or API response caching.
   - Monitor the performance of your SSR page and compare it with a non-cached version.

4. **Deploy Your Application**:
   - Deploy the Next.js SSR application to **Vercel** or another serverless platform.
   - Make sure the data is updated correctly on each request and test the performance.
