### **Submission Guidelines:**

- **Code Submission**: Submit a GitHub repository link containing your Next.js project.
- **Live URL**: Provide a link to the deployed SSR page (e.g., Vercel or Netlify).
- **Screenshots**: Include screenshots of the SSR page showing dynamic content.
- **Description**: In your submission, provide a brief explanation of how you implemented SSR with `getServerSideProps`, and mention any performance optimization techniques you applied.

### **Evaluation Criteria:**
1. **Correct Use of `getServerSideProps`**: Properly fetching data dynamically with `getServerSideProps`.
2. **Dynamic Content Handling**: Correct handling of dynamic data such as user-specific data or real-time content.
3. **Optimization Techniques**: Successful implementation of caching strategies or other performance optimizations.
4. **Deployment**: Correctly deploying the SSR Next.js app and ensuring it works in a live environment.
5. **Documentation**: Clear explanation and description of your approach, performance optimizations, and deployment process.

This dayâ€™s task will help you deepen your understanding of Server-Side Rendering (SSR) in Next.js and how to manage dynamic content in a scalable way while optimizing for performance. This is an essential skill for building web applications that require real-time data or highly dynamic content. 

Good luck!
