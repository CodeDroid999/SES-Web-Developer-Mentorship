### **Submission Guidelines:**

- **Code Submission**: Submit a GitHub repository link containing your Next.js project.
- **Live URL**: Provide a link to the deployed site (e.g., Vercel or Netlify).
- **Screenshots**: Include screenshots of the blog page and individual post pages.
- **Description**: In your submission, include a brief explanation of how you implemented SSG and ISR, and describe the benefits you observed from these approaches.

### **Resources:**

- [Next.js SSG Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended)
- [Next.js ISR Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration)
- [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)

### **Evaluation Criteria:**
1. **Correct Use of `getStaticProps`**: Properly fetching data at build time using `getStaticProps`.
2. **Dynamic Routing with `getStaticPaths`**: Ensuring dynamic routes are handled correctly using `getStaticPaths`.
3. **Proper Implementation of ISR**: Setting up ISR with a valid `revalidate` period to regenerate pages when necessary.
4. **Deployment**: Successfully deploying your application and ensuring everything works as expected in a live environment.
5. **Documentation**: Clear explanation and description of the solution and deployment process.

This dayâ€™s task will help you grasp the essentials of SSG and ISR, which are powerful tools for optimizing the performance and scalability of your Next.js applications.

Good luck!
