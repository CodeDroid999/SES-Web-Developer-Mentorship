# DAY ONE OF GITHUB WEB DESIGN
My journey has finally started, again for the third time. I gained interest in web design back in form two when I joined the school **ICT Club**. Every Wednesday we had an instructor from *Zalego Institute* who used to teach us HTML. To say that it was challenging would be an understatement. I kept wondering why something so cool could be so tough to master. However, I did my best and learnt ***HTML basics.*** 

Now in campus, I started learning HTML and CSS on my own through Youtube channels such as [Super Simple Dev](https://www.youtube.com/@SuperSimpleDev)  but it was still challenging since I did not know how to go about it. Every tutorial seemed shallow. I deviated a bit from web design and went into Python and C++ programming. But now with SES, I have renewed hope to learnt web design for real this time 😃.

I am documenting this 3-month journey here on my Github account so that one day I'll look back and be proud. I am praying for the strength to do this since I'll be juggling this course together with my Mechanical engineering degree (we do not learn this stuff so this is a whole new world for me). I am looking forward to mastering skills in:
1. HTML
   -Basic syntax
    -Forms and validation
     -Semantics
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. React

The journey has begun. My task list has one item already done:
[X] Learning the Markup Language
[X]HTML basics
[x] CSS basics
[] React

>[!NOTE]
>This is only a trial blog post for several Markup Skills.
