### Course Content

#### 1. Review of Day 4 Activities
- Recap the routing implementation and form handling using Formik from Day 4.
- Discuss the importance of performance optimization and best practices in front-end development.

#### 2. Performance Optimization Techniques
- **Understanding Performance Bottlenecks:**
  - Overview of common performance issues in React applications, such as unnecessary re-renders and heavy computations.

- **Techniques for Optimization:**
  - **Memoization:** Use `React.memo` and `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
  
  ```jsx
  const MemoizedComponent = React.memo(({ value }) => {
    return <div>{value}</div>;
  });
  ```

  - **Pure Components:** Use pure components to optimize rendering.
  
  ```jsx
  class MyComponent extends React.PureComponent {
    // ...
  }
  ```

#### 3. Code Splitting and Lazy Loading
- **Introduction to Code Splitting:**
  - Explanation of code splitting and its benefits for reducing initial load time.

- **Implementing Lazy Loading:**
  - Use `React.lazy` and `Suspense` to load components only when they are needed.

  ```jsx
  const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));

  function App() {
    return (
      <React.Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <LazyComponent />
      </React.Suspense>
    );
  }
  ```

#### 4. Best Practices for React Development
- **Component Structure and Organization:**
  - Guidelines for organizing components and files within a React application.

- **State Management:**
  - Best practices for managing local and global state effectively.

- **Handling Side Effects:**
  - Properly using hooks like `useEffect` and avoiding memory leaks.

#### 5. Accessibility in React Applications
- **Understanding Web Accessibility:**
  - Importance of making applications accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

- **Best Practices for Accessibility:**
  - Use semantic HTML elements, ARIA roles, and proper tab navigation.
  - Implementing accessible forms and buttons.

- **Testing Accessibility:**
  - Introduction to tools and libraries for testing accessibility in React applications (e.g., axe-core).

#### 6. Q&A and Wrap-up
- Open floor for questions regarding performance optimization, best practices, and accessibility.
- Recap of key takeaways from the week and how they integrate with the overall project.

### Required Materials
- Access to a computer with a code editor (e.g., VSCode) installed.
- Node.js and npm installed on your system.
- Familiarity with Git for version control.
