| **Submission Item**                    | **Description**                                                                                                         | **Format**                          |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Basic Routing Implementation**        | Set up basic routing in your application using React Router, including at least two pages (e.g., Home and About).      | Source code (e.g., App.js)         |
| **Dynamic Routing**                    | Implement a dynamic route that displays user information based on route parameters.                                     | Source code (e.g., UserProfile.js) |
| **Nested Routes**                      | Create a nested routing structure that includes a parent route and at least two child routes.                           | Source code (e.g., Dashboard.js)   |
| **404 Page Implementation**            | Implement a 404 Not Found page that displays when a route does not match any defined routes.                            | Source code (e.g., NotFoundPage.js)|
| **Redirects Implementation**           | Implement a route redirect to show how users can be redirected from an old route to a new one.                          | Source code (e.g., Redirects.js)   |
| **Documentation of Routing Concepts**  | Document your understanding of the routing concepts covered, including dynamic routing, nested routes, and redirects.  | Markdown file (routing_concepts.md) |
| **Feedback/Reflections**               | Write a brief reflection on your learning experience regarding React Router and its application in SPAs.                | Markdown file (reflections.md)      |
