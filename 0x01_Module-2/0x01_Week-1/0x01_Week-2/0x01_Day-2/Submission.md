### Submission Guidelines

Participants are required to submit the following items for the completion of Day 2 activities. Ensure that all submissions are organized in the same directory and clearly labeled.

| **Submission Item**                     | **Description**                                                                                                      | **Format**                          |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Selectors Implementation**             | Create and implement at least one selector to extract and derive data from the Redux store.                         | Source code (e.g., selectors.js)   |
| **Redux Toolkit Slice**                  | Create a slice using Redux Toolkit, including initial state and at least one action and reducer.                     | Source code (e.g., mySlice.js)     |
| **Saga Implementation**                  | Implement a simple saga to handle an asynchronous action and demonstrate its usage in your application.              | Source code (e.g., sagas.js)       |
| **Redux Logic Tests**                   | Write tests for your reducers, actions, and sagas to ensure they work as expected.                                  | Source code (e.g., reducers.test.js)|
| **Documentation of Advanced Concepts**  | Document your understanding of advanced Redux concepts, including selectors, Redux Toolkit, and sagas.              | Markdown file (advanced_concepts.md) |
| **Feedback/Reflections**                | Write a brief reflection on your learning journey regarding advanced Redux concepts and their implementation.         | Markdown file (reflections.md)     |
