| **Context Implementation**             | Create a context for managing a simple piece of state (e.g., user information or theme) and provide it in your application. | Source code (e.g., MyContext.js)   |
| **Functional Component Using Context**| Create a functional component that consumes the context and displays its value.                                        | Source code (e.g., MyComponent.js) |
| **Context State Update**               | Implement a method to update the context state and demonstrate it in your functional component.                        | Source code (e.g., MyComponent.js) |
| **Documentation of Context API Concepts**| Document your understanding of the Context API, including when to use it versus Redux.                                 | Markdown file (context_concepts.md) |
| **Feedback/Reflections**               | Write a brief reflection on your learning experience regarding state management in React and using the Context API.   | Markdown file (reflections.md)      |
