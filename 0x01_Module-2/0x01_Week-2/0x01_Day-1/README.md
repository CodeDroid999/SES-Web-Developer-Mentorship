### Course Content

#### 1. Review of Day 5 Activities
- Recap the performance optimizations and best practices implemented in the application.
- Discuss any challenges faced and solutions found during the optimization process.

#### 2. Introduction to State Management
- **What is State Management?**
  - Explanation of how state management helps in managing the data flow in applications.
  - Overview of different state management approaches (local state, prop drilling, context API, etc.).

- **Why Use a State Management Library?**
  - Benefits of using a library like Redux for managing global state in larger applications.

#### 3. Understanding Redux
- **Overview of Redux:**
  - Introduction to Redux as a predictable state container for JavaScript applications.
  
- **Key Concepts:**
  - **Store:** The single source of truth that holds the application state.
  - **Actions:** Plain JavaScript objects that describe what happened in the application.
  - **Reducers:** Functions that specify how the state changes in response to actions.

- **Redux Flow:**
  - Explanation of the unidirectional data flow in Redux (Action → Reducer → Store → View).

#### 4. Setting Up Redux in Your Application
- **Installing Redux and React-Redux:**
  - Use npm to install Redux and React-Redux in your existing application.

  ```bash
  npm install redux react-redux
  ```

- **Creating the Redux Store:**
  - Set up a basic Redux store in your application.

  ```jsx
  import { createStore } from 'redux';

  const initialState = { /* your initial state */ };

  const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
      // Define your action handlers here
      default:
        return state;
    }
  };

  const store = createStore(reducer);
  ```

#### 5. Connecting Redux with React Components
- **Providing the Store to the App:**
  - Use the `<Provider>` component from React-Redux to make the store available to all components.

  ```jsx
  import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
  
  function App() {
    return (
      <Provider store={store}>
        {/* Your components here */}
      </Provider>
    );
  }
  ```

- **Using `connect` to Access Redux State and Actions:**
  - Connect React components to the Redux store using the `connect` function.

  ```jsx
  import { connect } from 'react-redux';

  const MyComponent = ({ myState, myAction }) => {
    return (
      <div>
        {/* Render state and dispatch action */}
      </div>
    );
  };

  const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
    myState: state.myState,
  });

  const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
    myAction: () => dispatch({ type: 'MY_ACTION' }),
  });

  export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(MyComponent);
  ```

#### 6. Middleware in Redux
- **Introduction to Middleware:**
  - Explain the purpose of middleware in Redux for handling asynchronous actions.

- **Using Redux Thunk:**
  - Install and set up Redux Thunk for handling async actions.

  ```bash
  npm install redux-thunk
  ```

  ```jsx
  import { applyMiddleware, createStore } from 'redux';
  import thunk from 'redux-thunk';

  const store = createStore(reducer, applyMiddleware(thunk));
  ```

#### 7. Q&A and Wrap-up
- Open floor for questions regarding state management and Redux concepts.
- Recap of key takeaways from the day and how they integrate with the overall project.

### Required Materials
- Access to a computer with a code editor (e.g., VSCode) installed.
- Node.js and npm installed on your system.
- Familiarity with Git for version control.
