### Course Content

#### 1. Introduction to State Management
- **Understanding State in React:**
  - Discuss the importance of state management in React applications. Explain how state impacts the user experience and how effective management can enhance application performance.

#### 2. What is Redux?
- **Overview of Redux:**
  - Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps manage application state in a centralized store, making it easier to understand and maintain.

#### 3. Key Concepts of Redux
- **Core Principles:**
  - **Single Source of Truth:** The entire state of the application is stored in a single object.
  - **State is Read-Only:** The only way to change the state is by dispatching actions.
  - **Changes are Made with Pure Functions:** To specify how the state changes in response to actions, you write pure reducers.

#### 4. Setting Up Redux in a React Application
- **Installation:**
  ```bash
  npm install redux react-redux
  ```

- **Basic Usage:**
  ```javascript
  import { createStore } from 'redux';
  import { Provider } from 'react-redux';

  const store = createStore(reducer);

  const App = () => (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <YourComponent />
    </Provider>
  );
  ```

#### 5. Creating Redux Store
- **Creating a Basic Store:**
  - Explain how to create a Redux store with a simple reducer.
  
  ```javascript
  const initialState = { counter: 0 };

  const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
      case 'INCREMENT':
        return { counter: state.counter + 1 };
      case 'DECREMENT':
        return { counter: state.counter - 1 };
      default:
        return state;
    }
  };

  const store = createStore(reducer);
  ```

#### 6. Actions and Action Creators
- **Defining Actions:**
  - Describe how actions are plain JavaScript objects that describe changes in the state.

  ```javascript
  const increment = () => ({ type: 'INCREMENT' });
  const decrement = () => ({ type: 'DECREMENT' });
  ```

- **Using Action Creators:**
  - Show how to use action creators in a component.

#### 7. Reducers and State Updates
- **Creating Reducers:**
  - Explain the purpose of reducers and how they specify how the applicationâ€™s state changes in response to actions.

- **Combining Reducers:**
  - Discuss how to use `combineReducers` to manage multiple slices of state.

#### 8. Connecting React with Redux
- **Using `connect` from React-Redux:**
  - Demonstrate how to connect a React component to the Redux store.

  ```javascript
  import { connect } from 'react-redux';

  const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({ counter: state.counter });

  const CounterComponent = ({ counter }) => <div>{counter}</div>;

  export default connect(mapStateToProps)(CounterComponent);
  ```

#### 9. Using Redux Toolkit
- **Introduction to Redux Toolkit:**
  - Discuss the benefits of using Redux Toolkit for simpler store setup and enhanced development experience.

- **Creating a Slice:**
  - Show how to use `createSlice` for handling state logic.

  ```javascript
  import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

  const counterSlice = createSlice({
    name: 'counter',
    initialState: { value: 0 },
    reducers: {
      increment: (state) => { state.value += 1; },
      decrement: (state) => { state.value -= 1; },
    },
  });

  export const { increment, decrement } = counterSlice.actions;
  export default counterSlice.reducer;
  ```

#### 10. Q&A and Wrap-up
- **Open Floor for Questions:**
  - Encourage participants to ask questions about using Redux for state management in React applications.

- **Recap of Key Takeaways:**
  - Summarize the importance of state management and the advantages of using Redux, especially with Redux Toolkit for improved development efficiency.

### Required Materials
- Access to a computer with a code editor (e.g., VSCode) installed.
- Node.js and npm installed on your system.
