### Submission Guidelines

Participants are required to submit the following items for the completion of Day 3 activities. Ensure that all submissions are organized in the same directory and clearly labeled.

| **Submission Item**                     | **Description**                                                                                          | **Format**                             |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Context API Implementation**          | Create a simple React application demonstrating state management using Context API.                     | Source code (e.g., App.js, context.js)|
| **Redux Implementation**                | Set up a basic Redux application that manages state for a counter.                                      | Source code (e.g., counter.js, store.js) |
| **Actions and Reducers**                | Document your actions and reducers used in your Redux implementation.                                   | Markdown file (actions_reducers.md)    |
| **Documentation of State Management Concepts** | Write a brief explanation of when to use Context API vs. Redux and the key concepts of each.           | Markdown file (state_management.md)     |
| **Feedback/Reflections**                | Write a brief reflection on your learning experience regarding state management in React.               | Markdown file (reflections.md)         |
