## Submissions for Module 2, Week 3, Day 1: React Routing with React Router

### Submission Guidelines

Participants are required to submit the following items for the completion of Day 1 activities. Ensure that all submissions are organized in the same directory and clearly labeled.

| **Submission Item**                     | **Description**                                                                                          | **Format**                             |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Basic Routing Application**           | Create a simple React application that demonstrates basic routing using React Router.                  | Source code (e.g., App.js, routes.js) |
| **Nested Routes Implementation**        | Implement nested routes in your application.                                                            | Source code (e.g., nestedRoutes.js)   |
| **Dynamic Routing Example**             | Create a route that accepts a parameter and displays dynamic content based on that parameter.           | Source code (e.g., UserProfile.js)    |
| **Programmatic Navigation Example**     | Implement a button that navigates to another route programmatically using the `useHistory` hook.        | Source code (e.g., LoginButton.js)    |
| **Documentation of Routing Concepts**   | Document your understanding of React Router concepts, including basic routing, nested routes, and dynamic routing. | Markdown file (routing_concepts.md)    |
| **Feedback/Reflections**                | Write a brief reflection on your learning experience regarding React Routing and how it can be applied. | Markdown file (reflections.md)         |

### Additional Notes
- Ensure that your applications are functional and well-tested before submission.
- Follow best practices for organizing your code and naming files.
- Submit your work by the specified deadline to facilitate timely feedback.

### Submission Format
All submissions should be uploaded as a compressed file (.zip) containing the code files and documentation, clearly labeled with your name and the module/week information.
