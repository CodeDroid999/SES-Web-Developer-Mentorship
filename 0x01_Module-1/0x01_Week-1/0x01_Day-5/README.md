## Tasks

Today's tasks will provide you with hands-on experience in working with different types of links and creating a multipage website with a navigation bar. Follow the steps carefully, and don't hesitate to ask questions if you need assistance.

### Task 1: Internal Links

Internal links are used to navigate within the same web page, allowing you to link to different sections or elements. Let's practice creating internal links:

1. Open your text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).

2. Create a new HTML file named `index.html`.

3. Add content to your HTML file, including different sections with headings or elements.

4. Create internal links in the navigation menu that, when clicked, smoothly scroll to the corresponding sections within the page.

### Task 2: External Links

External links are used to navigate to websites or resources outside of your own website. In this task, you'll create external links:

1. Open your `index.html` file from Task 1.

2. Add a new section to your web page that includes links to external websites or resources. You can use social media profiles, your LinkedIn profile, or any websites of your choice.

3. Create these links to open in a new tab or window for a seamless user experience.

### Task 3: Navigation Bar

A navigation bar is a common feature on websites that provides easy access to different pages. In this task, you'll create a navigation bar that links to multiple pages:

1. Create a new HTML file for a second page of your website, named `about.html`.

2. Add a navigation bar to both your `index.html` and `about.html` pages. The navigation bar should include links to both pages.

3. Ensure that clicking on these links takes you to the corresponding page.

4. Make sure your navigation bar maintains a consistent appearance on both pages, providing a smooth and user-friendly navigation experience.

### Conclusion

By completing these tasks, you've gained valuable experience in creating different types of links and implementing navigation bars in multipage websites. These skills are fundamental in web development and will serve you well in future projects.

Remember that practice is key to mastering these concepts, so feel free to experiment with your multipage site and explore more advanced navigation options in your own projects.

Great job on completing Day 5 of our Web Mentorship Program! Keep up the good work.
