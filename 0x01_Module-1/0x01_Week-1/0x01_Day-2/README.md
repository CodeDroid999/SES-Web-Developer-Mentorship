## Tasks

### Task 1: Create Your Web Page

1. Open your text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).
2. Create a new HTML file named \`index.html\`. You can copy and paste the following command into your terminal to create the file:

```
index.html
```

3. Set the title **Catopedia** for your web page by adding the `<title>` element within the `<head>` section. This is a title that reflects the content of your page.
4. Build a basic web page structure with the following elements:
   - Use a `<header>` element to create a header section.
   - Use a `<nav>` element to create a navigation menu.
   - Use a `<main>` element to define the main content of your page.
   - Use a `<footer>` element to create a footer section.
5. Within the `<main>` section, include a heading (`<h1>`) with a meaningful title for your web page.
6. Create a section for displaying cat images. You can use the `<img>` element to display at least three cat images. Here are some stock photo links for different cat breeds:
   - Siamese Cat: <a href="https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcST4vFqkon9beoNKaEGwJsaFJTR7l61rtMhYJgvHEWuc0QT5ajF">Click to view image 1</a>
   - Maine Coon Cat: <a href="https://media.istockphoto.com/id/819476630/photo/portrait-of-maine-coon-cat-on-black-background.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=-LjNMvz5RQOIczZS3QhI0ElDyi8a2esqbB-OT8QLkak=">Click to view Image 2</a>
   - Persian Cat: <a href="https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1135793728/photo/white-persian-cats.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=UeroNOVgXc3wUrR_tIBhT1uH_iAoH_ZZo9I95_L-mqU=">Click to view image 3</a>
7. For each cat breed, provide the following information using appropriate HTML elements:

   - **The breed of the cat**: Use a `<h2>` element to create a subheading for the breed name. For example:

```
<h2>Siamese Cat</h2>
```

- **Lifespan of the breed**: Use a `<p>` (paragraph) element to display the lifespan information. For example:

```
<p>Lifespan: 15-20 years</p>
```

- **Characteristics of the breed**: Use an unordered list `<ul>` with list items `<li>` to list the characteristics. For example:

```
<h3>Characteristics:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Distinctive color points on the ears, face, paws, and tail</li>
<li>Blue almond-shaped eyes</li>
<li>Short coat with a sleek appearance</li>
</ul>
```

- **Other interesting facts or information about the breed**: Use a `<p>` element to provide additional information. For example:

```
<p>The Siamese cat is known for its vocal nature and social personality.</p>
```

Repeat these HTML structure elements for each of the three cat breeds you are featuring on your web page (Siamese, Maine Coon, and Persian).

### Task 2: Add Images and Links

1. Find an image online or use one from your computer.
2. Add the image to your web page using the `<img>` element.
3. Create at least two links within your content, linking to other web pages or websites.

### Task 3: Test Your Web Page

1. Open your `index.html` file in a web browser to view your web page.
2. Ensure that the structure and content appear as intended.
