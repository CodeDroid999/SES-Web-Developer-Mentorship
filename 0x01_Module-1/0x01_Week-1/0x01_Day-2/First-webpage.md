# Tasks

### Task 1: Create Your Web Page

1. Open your text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).
2. Create a new HTML file named `index.html`. You can copy and paste the following command into your terminal to create the file:

```
 index.html
```

3. Set a specific title for your web page by adding the `<title>` element within the `<head>` section. Choose a title that reflects the content of your page.

4. Build a basic web page structure with the following elements:

- Use a `<header>` element to create a header section.
- Use a `<nav>` element to create a navigation menu.
- Use a `<main>` element to define the main content of your page.
- Use a `<footer>` element to create a footer section.

5. Within the `<main>` section, include a heading (`<h1>`) with a meaningful title for your web page.

6. Create a section for displaying cat images. You can use the `<img>` element to display at least three cat images. Here are some stock photo links for different cat breeds:

- Siamese Cat: ![Siamese Cat](insert_siamese_cat_image_link_here)
- Maine Coon Cat: ![Maine Coon Cat](insert_maine_coon_cat_image_link_here)
- Persian Cat: ![Persian Cat](insert_persian_cat_image_link_here)
- Make sure to include an `alt` attribute for each image.

7. For each cat breed, provide the following information using appropriate HTML elements:

- **The breed of the cat**: Use a `<h2>` element to create a subheading for the breed name. For example:

  ```
  <h2>Siamese Cat</h2>
  ```

- **Lifespan of the breed**: Use a `<p>` (paragraph) element to display the lifespan information. For example:

  ```
  <p>Lifespan: 15-20 years</p>
  ```

- **Characteristics of the breed**: Use an unordered list (`<ul>`) with list items (`<li>`) to list the characteristics. For example:

  ```
  <h3>Characteristics:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Distinctive color points on the ears, face, paws, and tail</li>
    <li>Blue almond-shaped eyes</li>
    <li>Short coat with a sleek appearance</li>
  </ul>
  ```

- **Other interesting facts or information about the breed**: Use a `<p>` element to provide additional information. For example:
  ```
  <p>The Siamese cat is known for its vocal nature and social personality.</p>
  ```

Repeat these HTML structure elements for each of the three cat breeds you are featuring on your web page (Siamese, Maine Coon, and Persian).

### Task 2: Add Images and Links

1. Find an image online or use one from your computer.

2. Add the image to your web page using the `<img>` element. Ensure that you provide an `alt` attribute for accessibility. Here's an example of how to add an image:

```
<img src="image_url_here" alt="Description of the image">
```

### Task 3: Test Your Web Page

1. Open your `index.html` file in a web browser to view your web page.

2. Ensure that the structure and content appear as intended. Check that your headings, images, and text are properly formatted and displayed.

3. Test the links to verify they navigate correctly. Click on each link you created in Task 2 and confirm that they open the respective web pages or websites.

4. Make any necessary adjustments to your web page's HTML or content if you encounter issues during testing.

Once you have completed these tasks, your web page should be ready for review and submission.

### Task 4: Submit your code for review.

Go to [SUBMISSIONS.md](https://github.com/CodeDroid999/SES-Web-Developer-Mentorship/blob/main/0x01_Module-1/0x01_Week-1/0x01_Day-2/SUBMISSIONS.md) to submit your code.
