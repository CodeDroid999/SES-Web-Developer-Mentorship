# Day 3: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

Welcome to Day 3 of our Web Mentorship Program! Today, we're delving into the world of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), a crucial technology in web development. CSS allows you to control the presentation and layout of your web pages, making them visually appealing and user-friendly.

## Understanding CSS Basics

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation and styling of HTML documents. With CSS, you can control the appearance of elements on your web pages, including fonts, colors, spacing, and layout. CSS follows a rule-based syntax, where you define rules that specify how different elements should be styled.

Key CSS Concepts:
- **Selectors**: These define which HTML elements the styles will be applied to.
- **Properties**: These determine what aspect of the element's style will be changed (e.g., color, font-size).
- **Values**: Values are assigned to properties and define how the style should be applied (e.g., `red` for color, `20px` for font-size).

CSS can be applied in three ways: **internal**, **external**, and **in-line**. Each method has its use cases and advantages.
