## Tasks

Today's tasks involve adding Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS to a simple web page and using them to style various elements.


### Task 1: Create a GitHub Repository
1. Create a new GitHub repository named "SES-Web-CSS-Framework"
```
SES-Web-CSS-Frameworks
```
2. Initialize the repository with a README file.

3. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.

5. Prepare the repository for your CSS framework tasks by creating folders and files as needed.

6. Commit the initial changes and push them to the remote repository.
### Task 2: Adding Bootstrap to Your Web Page

1. Open your text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).

2. Create a new HTML file named `index-bootstrap.html`.

3. Include the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files by adding the following code within the `<head>` section of your HTML file:

```
<link
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.0-beta1/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.0-beta1/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
```

4. Within the `<body>` section of your HTML file, use Bootstrap classes to style the existing elements in your web page. For example, you can use the `container` class to create a responsive container, and the `btn` class to style buttons.

### Task 3: Adding Tailwind CSS to Your Web Page

1. Create a new HTML file named `index-tailwind.html`.

2. Include the Tailwind CSS file by adding the following code within the `<head>` section of your HTML file:

```
<link
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tailwindcss@2.2.19/dist/tailwind.min.css"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

3. Within the `<body>` section of your HTML file, use Tailwind CSS classes to style the existing elements in your web page. For example, you can use classes like `bg-blue-500` to set a background color and `text-white` to set text color.

### Task 4: Compare and Contrast

1. Once you've added Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS to your web pages and styled the elements, compare and contrast the two frameworks.

2. Take note of the differences in terms of ease of use, customization options, and the overall styling experience.

3. Consider which framework you found more suitable for your specific web project.
