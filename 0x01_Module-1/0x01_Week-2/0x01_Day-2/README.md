# Week2 Day2: Introduction to JavaScript

## Introduction

Welcome to Day 2 of Week 2! Today, we dive into the fundamental programming language for web development - JavaScript. JavaScript is the scripting language that makes your web pages interactive. Whether you want to build dynamic web applications or create interactive features, JavaScript is the key to bringing your web pages to life.

In today's session, we will start with the basics of JavaScript, understand how to write and execute JavaScript code, and explore the Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM is the representation of the web page's structure that JavaScript can interact with, allowing us to create dynamic and responsive web applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you will:

- Understand the basics of JavaScript, including variables, data types, and basic syntax.
- Learn how to write JavaScript code in an HTML document.
- Gain insights into JavaScript's role in making web pages interactive.
- Explore the DOM and how JavaScript can manipulate web page elements.
- Practice hands-on examples to solidify your understanding.

## Resources

Let's get started by exploring some resources to help you learn JavaScript and DOM manipulation:

### JavaScript Basics:

### DOM Manipulation:

1. **MDN Web Docs: Document Object Model (DOM)**:

   - [MDN DOM Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model): MDN's documentation on the DOM, explaining how web pages are structured.

2. **W3Schools DOM Tutorial**:

## Tasks

Today's tasks will involve practicing the basics of JavaScript and working with the DOM to make simple web page modifications.

### Task 1: Create a GitHub Repo

1. Create a new GitHub repository with the name `SES-Web_Introduction-to-JavaScript`. You can create a new repository on GitHub's website.

```
SES-Web_Introduction-to-JavaScript
```

### Task 2: Basic JavaScript Practice

1. Create a new HTML file named `index-js.html`.

```
index-js.html
```

2. Inside the `<body>` section, use the `<script>` tag to write JavaScript code that accomplishes the following:

   - Declare a variable.
   - Assign a value to the variable.
   - Use `console.log()` to display the value in the browser's console.

3. Open the HTML file in a web browser and inspect the browser's console to verify that your JavaScript code executed correctly.

### Task 3: DOM Manipulation

1. Create another HTML file named `dom-manipulation.html`.

2. Build a simple HTML structure with a heading, a paragraph, and a button.

3. Write JavaScript code to do the following:

   - Select the button element using JavaScript.
   - Add an event listener to the button so that when it's clicked, it changes the text of the paragraph.

4. Open the HTML file in a web browser and test your interactive page. Click the button to see the text change in response.

### Task 4: Interactive Web Page

1. Create a new HTML file named `interactive-page.html`.

2. Build an HTML structure that includes a heading, a button, and a div element.

3. Write JavaScript code to do the following:

   - Select the button and div elements using JavaScript.
   - Add an event listener to the button.
   - When the button is clicked, use JavaScript to toggle the visibility of the div element.

4. Open the HTML file in a web browser to test your interactive web page. Click the button to show or hide the content within the div.

Remember to experiment and get comfortable with JavaScript's syntax and the basics of DOM manipulation. These foundational skills will be incredibly valuable as you continue your journey in web development.

## Conclusion

Today, you've embarked on your JavaScript journey. We covered the basics and explored how JavaScript can interact with the DOM to make web pages dynamic and responsive. As you continue to learn and practice, you'll gain the skills needed to create interactive web applications. Stay curious and keep coding!
