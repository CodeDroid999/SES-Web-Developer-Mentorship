## Week 2, Day 4: Project 2 - Weather App

Welcome to your next coding project! In this project, you'll be building a weather app using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and APIs. The goal is to create a web-based application that allows users to check the current weather conditions in a specific location.

### Project Requirements

1. **HTML Structure:**
   - Create an HTML file named `weather.html`.
   - Design the basic structure of your weather app. Include input fields for users to enter a location (city, country) and a button to fetch weather data.

2. **CSS Styling:**
   - Create a CSS file named `styles.css` to style your weather app.
   - Apply CSS styles to make your app visually appealing and user-friendly.

3. **JavaScript and API Integration:**
   - Create a JavaScript file named `script.js` to handle the app's functionality.
   - Integrate a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to fetch weather data based on user input.
   - Display the weather information, including temperature, weather conditions, and a weather icon.

4. **User Interaction:**
   - Ensure that users can enter a location and trigger the weather data retrieval.
   - Provide a responsive and interactive user interface.
