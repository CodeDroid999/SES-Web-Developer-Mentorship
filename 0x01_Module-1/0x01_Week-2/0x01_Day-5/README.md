After that, they should share the repository link in the submissions section of the submissions.md file. This project allows students to apply what they've learned to create a practical and interactive web app.

#### Steps

To submit your completed To-Do List Web App project, follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. **Create a New GitHub Repository:**
   - Go to your GitHub account.
   - Click on the "New" button to create a new repository.
   - Name your repository, for example, "To-Do-List-Web-App."

2. **Push Your Project Files:**
   - Make sure your project files, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, are organized and ready in your local directory.
   - Use Git to initialize the repository and add your files. You can do this with the following commands in your terminal or Git client:

   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

3. **Link Your Local Repository to GitHub:**
   - Go to your GitHub repository's page.
   - Under "Quick setup," you'll find a set of commands. Copy the one that starts with `git remote add origin`.

4. **Push Your Project Files to GitHub:**
   - Paste the command you copied from the GitHub repository page into your terminal and hit Enter. It should look something like this:

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/To-Do-List-Web-App.git
   ```

   - After linking your local repository to the GitHub repository, you can push your project files:

   ```
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

5. **Share the Repository Link:**
   - After successfully pushing your project files to your GitHub repository, copy the repository's URL.

6. **Edit the Submissions.md File:**
   - In the main repository for this course, locate the "submissions.md" file.

7. **Add Your Submission:**
   - Open the "submissions.md" file and find the section dedicated to this project.
   - Add a new row to the table with your name and the link to your GitHub repository.

That's it! By following these steps, you'll have successfully submitted your To-Do List Web App project. Your project files will be accessible in your GitHub repository, and your submission link will be added to the main submissions file. This process ensures that you can showcase your practical and interactive web app while demonstrating your web development skills.
